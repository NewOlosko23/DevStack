# DevStack: Effortless MERN Stack Project Setup

DevStack is a command-line agent that automatically sets up a full MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with just one command. It eliminates the need for tedious manual setup, ensuring developers can jump straight into building features.

## Features:
- **React + Vite Setup**: Quickly creates a React frontend with Vite and Tailwind CSS for fast styling.
- **Express Server**: Automatically sets up a backend with Express, MongoDB, and common dependencies.
- **Pre-configured Routes & Controllers**: The agent creates basic routes and controllers for faster API development.
- **Boilerplate Cleanup**: Cleans unnecessary boilerplate code from both frontend and backend for better project organization.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Automatically integrates Tailwind CSS with Vite for rapid UI development.
- **Dependency Installation**: Installs all required and optional dependencies like Axios, React Router, Lucide-React, and more.
